Topic: Managing Input and ouput operations
-------------------------------------------
Introduction:
--------------
1. Reading, processing, and writing of data are the three essential 
   functions of a computer program.
   
2. Most programs take some data as input and display the processed data,
   often known as information or results, on a suitable medium.
   
3. So, far we have seen two methods of providing data to the 
   program variables.

4. One method is to assign values to variables through the 
   assignment statements such as x = 5; a = 0; and so on.
   
5. Another method is to use the input function scanf which 
   can read data from a keyboard.
   
6. We have used both the methods in most of our earlier example programs.

7. For outputting results we have used extensively the function printf
   which sends results out to a terminal. 

8. Unlike other high-level languages, C does not have any built-in 
   input/output statements as part of its syntax.

9. All input/output operations are carried out through function calls
   such as printf and scanf.

10. There exists several functions that have more or less become
    standard for input and output operations in C.

11. These functions are collectively known as standard I/O library.

12. In this video, we shall discuss some common I/O functions that can be
    used on many machines without any change.

13. However, one should consult the system reference manual for
    exact details of these functions and alsoto see what other 
	functions are availabale.

For example:

					#include <math.h>
					
.	This library math function is to instruct compiler to fetch the 
	functions sin, cos, exp etc.. from the math library, and that it
	is not a part of C language.
	
.   Similarly, each program that uses a standard input/output function
	must contain the statement.
	
                    #include <stdio.h>
					
.	This header file used at the beginning.

.	The file name 'stdio.h' is an abbrevation for 
	'standarad input -output header' file.
	
.	The instruction #include <stdio.h> tells the compiler 'to search for a 
	file named stdio.h and place its contents at this point in the program'.
	
.	The contents of the header file become part of the source code 
	when it is compiled.
   
Reading a character:
---------------------
1. The simplest of all input/output operations is reading a character
   from the 'standard input' unit (usually the keyboard) and writing it to 
   the 'standard output' unit (usually the screen).
   
2. Reading a single character can be done by using the function 'getchar'.
   
3. Syntax:
   ------- 		
					variable_name = getchar();

4. variable_name is a valid C name that has been declared as char type. 
   When this statement is encountered, the computer waits until a 
   key is pressed and then assigns this character as a 
   value to 'getchar' function.
   
5. For Example:
   ------------
					char name;
					
					name = getchar();
 
6. Will assign the character 'H' to the variable name when we press the key
   'H' on the keyboard. 

For Example 1:
-------------
	The program displays a question of YES/NO type to the user and reads
	the user's response in a single character (Y or N). If the response
	is Y or y, it outputs the message
	
						My name is Ravula Govardhan
					
	otherwise, outputs
				
						You are good for nothing 
   
Program:
---------
#include <stdio.h>
int
main()
{
    char answer;
    printf("Would you like to know my name?\n");
    
    printf("Type Y for YES and N for NO:");
    answer = getchar(); /* --- Reading a character --- */
    
    if(answer == 'Y' || answer == 'y')
        printf("\n\nMy name is Ravula Govardhan\n");
    else
        printf("\n\nYou are good for nothing\n");
    
    return 0;
} 
   
output:
-------
	Would you like to know my name?
	Type Y for YES and N for NO: Y
	My name is Ravula Govardhan
	Would you like to know my name?
	Type Y for YES and N for No: n
	You are good for nothing
 

For Example 2:
--------------
	This program receives a character from the keyboard and test 
	whether it is a letter or digit and prints out a message accordingly.
	These tests are done with the help of the following functions:
	
					isalpha(character)
					isdigit(character)
					
Program:
--------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
int
main()
{
    char character;
    printf("Press any key\n");
    character = getchar();
    
    if(isalpha(character)>0) /* Test for letter */
        printf("The character is a letter.");
    else
        if(isdigit(character)>0) /* Test for digit */
            printf("The character is a digit.");
        else
            printf("The character is not alpha numeric.");
    return 0;
}

output:
-------
		Press any key
		h
		The character is a letter.
		Press any key
		5
		The character is a digit.
		Press any key
		*
		The character is not alphanumeric.
